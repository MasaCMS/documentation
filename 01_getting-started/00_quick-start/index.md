# Quick Start 

Follow this guide to have a Masa CSM instance running in no time.

1. Download and install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/), if you not already have done so.

2. Download Masa CMS from this direct [download](https://github.com/MasaCMS/MasaCMS/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) link.
A .zip file is now being download.

3. Unzip the .zip file into a directory of you choice. We will refer in this guide to this as the `MasaCMSRootDir`.

4. Goto your `MasaCMSRootDir` in a terminal window.

5. CD in the following subdirectory:
    * `\core\docker\local-mysql` for Windows and Mac
    * `/core/docker/local-mysql` for Linux 

6.  Type in the following command:  `docker-compose up`.
Two Docker containers will start, one for the database and one for Masa CMS.

   NOTE: Mac users will have to change the port number for the database container, since that port is already in use by the OS itself. You can do this by editing the 'docker-compose.yml' file. Change the variables `MURA_DBCONNECTIONSTRING` and `MURA_DBPORT`. Also be sure to change the port number on line 51 for het MySQL Docker container accordingly.

7. Goto [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to visit your local Masa CMS site.

8. Goto [http:/localhost:8080/admin](http:/localhost:8080/admin) to visit the Masa CMS Adminstator. You can login with the following credentials:
    * Username: `admin`
    * Password: `admin`
