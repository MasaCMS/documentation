# Editing Content/Publishing

You can edit content and publish it via the following ways:

## Inline Edit
When you are logged in as a User in the Masa CMS Admin, the [Front-End Toolbar](/getting-started/basic-concepts/front-end-toolbar/) is displayed on top of your page. You can use the 'Inline edit' mode to edit the page and all the Modules that have been placed on the page. 

Different parts of the page light up in red for you to edit, like the 'Title' and the 'Body'.

The 'Title' field is just a simple input field, but the 'Body' has a Rich Text editor.

Both field can be edited by double-clicking on them. When you are done editing the field, click on 'Done Editing' on the right side of the page.
