# Plugins
A Masa Plugin may have it's own set of Modules (sometimes refered to as "display objects") to render it's front-end content. If a plugin has Modules/Display Objects associated with it, then these will be available within the Plugin's Configurator.

Note that this Module only appears if there are plugins installed in your Masa instance.
