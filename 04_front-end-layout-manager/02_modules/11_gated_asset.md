# Gated Asset
New in 7.4
{: .label .label-orange }
{: .no_toc }

The Gated Asset Module gates access to a page or download URL. *Note:* this is a basic content gate, and in no way secures the destination url.

## Configuration
Configuring a Gated Asset requires that you select a Form (which must be completed in order to open the "gate") and a set of pre/post-content messages to complete the process. The Gate can appear either inline on a page or as a modal. Once the form is submitted, the user will be presented with a button that directs them to the gated content via a URL.
