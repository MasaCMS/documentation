# Container
The Container Module acts as a placeholder for other Modules, or even other Containers. These can be used to layout a page or section and apply specific CSS styling to sections of the page.

*Note*: it is better to use CSS/styling to layout complex content than use multiple nested containers, as there is a small but increasing performance penalty the more deeply you nest Containers.
