## 7.2.1

### Security Vulnerability Fix
{: .no_toc }


#### What was the issue ?
{: .no_toc }

We’ve been informed of a security vulnerability that allows any user to request files outside the asset folder from the server. 

#### What is fixed ?
{: .no_toc }

We’ve improved the security around the assets API endpoint that is affected, to validate that the user can only request assets from the assets folder. In the process we’ve also applied restrictions to the asset upload endpoint, so that only logged in editors can upload assets.

#### What versions are affected?
{: .no_toc }

Only Masa CMS version 7.2 is affected

#### What should you upgrade ?
{: .no_toc }

If you’re on Masa CMS 7.2, you should update to version 7.2.1 immediately. This can be done by using the “Update Masa CMS Core” option in the menu of the Masa CMS Administrator or by applying a manual update.
