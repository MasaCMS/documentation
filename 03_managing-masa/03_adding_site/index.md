2. Now a form is displayed; **"Site ID"** is the only mandatory field. The Site ID will be a created as a directory in the Masa {context}.
So keep it simple and just create a siteID which isn't to complex.

3. Its a good practice to also fill in the fields **"Site Name"** and **"Primary Domain"** so the site has a label and a domain is linked to the site.
