# Contributing

Thank you for showing interest to contribute to the Masa CMS documentation. In this section we'll explain how you can help completing this documentation.

You have the option to make your changes directly on GitHub, [in your browser](#in-your-browser). This is ideal for small contributions.

For larger contributions, it's easier to make your changes locally, [in your code editor](#in-your-code-editor). But this will require some work setting up the project locally.

## In your browser

In the footer of every page in this documentation, you'll find a link to 'Edit this page on GitHub'. By clicking this link you'll be directed to GitHub, where you can edit the page (in Markdown).

### Editing

GitHub provides an in browser file editor you can use to make your changes. The Masa CMS documentation uses [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) as formating syntax.

Don't forget to update the `last_modified_date` in the configuration block at the top of the page.

### Preview

Just above your code editor, you'll find a tab 'preview'. When you open this tab, the Markdown file you're working on will be rendered in the browser and you're able to preview the changes you've made.

Now you are ready to commit your changes.

### Commit changes

Below the file editor, you'll see a form. Please provide a title and a description for your changes. Choose which email address to associate with this commit and select the option to 'Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request.'.

### Open a pull request

Now you can review your changes and create a pull request.

Don't forget to sign the contributor agreement, the first time you create a pull request. You can do this by clicking the "CLA not signed yet"-button or by following the instructions in the email you'll receive.

## In your code editor

You can choose to work on your contributions and preview them on your own computer. To do this, you'll have to fork the project, clone the repository locally and follow the instructions in the [README.md](https://github.com/MasaCMS/documentation/blob/main/README.md) file to set up, build and run the documentation.

Once you have made your changes, commit and push them to your fork. Now you can create a pull request against our repository.
