# Front-end toolbar

The Front-end Toolbar is a useful tool for inline editing the content of your page. 
It's displayed on top of the website when you are logged into the Masa CMS Admin.
In the following sections the different features are described from left to right.

## Switch visibility of the Front-end toolbar
The first option is the Masa CMS Logo in the Front-end Toolbar. By clicking on the logo you can switch between a full Front-end Toolbar and a small Masa CMS icon. This feature is convenient when you have content directly at the top of page of you website and want to view it.

1. Full toolbar:

2. Icon:

## Published and Save
The second option is the 'Published' and 'Save' option.
The options switch depending on if you've made changes on the page or not.

When the page is not changed and you click on 'Published' a popup will open and show you publishing information of the page.

When changes are made on the page the 'Published' option is changed to a 'Save' dropdown menu.

This menu has the following options:

1. Publish: save the changes and publish them directly.
2. Save Draft: save the changes as a draft to edit and publish later.
3. Save to Change Set: save the changes to a Changeset for updating the site in bulk.
4. Cancel: all changes are discarded.
