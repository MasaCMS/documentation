# Components

## Adding Components
Component are small parts of content that can be placed on parts of the template of a Masa CMS Page. Their power lies in their re-usability; a single component can be used numerous of times. For example; a component that resembles a banner can be placed on multiple templates on your site. When this banner component is updated, then automatically the banner is updated on the whole site.

You can add a component as follow:

1. Goto the overview of content. Select 'Component'. An overview of components is shown.
