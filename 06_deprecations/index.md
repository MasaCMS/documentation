# Deprecations

A deprecation is a feature that still exists and works at this time in Masa CMS, but we will want to remove in the future.
Features that are marked as 'deprecated' wil still work in the current verions of Masa CMS, but in future releases might be removed.
It is therefore recommend to not use these deprecated features anymore and upgrade your code accordingly.

To create more insight in which functionality is deprecated in your curren Masa installation you take a look at the [Deprecation Warnings](/deprecations/deprecation_warnings/)
