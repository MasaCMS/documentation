# Contribute to translations

Do you speak a language other than English and you're willing to help out [translating](#translate) or [proofreading](#proofread)? You're welcome to help us out!

We've setup a Crowdin project to collaborate together on translating the Masa CMS interface into as much languages as possible: [https://crowdin.com/project/masacms](https://crowdin.com/project/masacms).

On the home page of the project, select the language you want to help out with. For each language we have two files:

* `/core/en.properties`: The labels for the Masa CMS administrator
* `/modules/core_assets/en.properties`: The labels for the Masa CMS core modules

## Translate

Next to the file you want to translate, click on the 'three dots'-icon and select the "translate" option.

The translating interface opens up for the language and file selected.
